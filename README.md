Normalize GUI
=============
A GUI by Bruce Heller for the [PCM WAV normalizer command-line utility](https://github.com/mesheets/NormalizeCLI)

Add the GUI executable and associated INI file to the same directory as the Normalize CLI executable,
or ensure that the CLI executable is in your PATH.

Available as a [PortableApp.com](https://portableapps.com/) package at the [link here](https://github.com/mesheets/PAF-NormalizePortable).

From Bruce:
-----------
After some research over the net, I discover that there wasn't any GUI for the great tool [Normalize](https://github.com/mesheets/NormalizeCLI) is.
So I decided to take a little of my time to do one.
This is what you got now ;).

(UPDATE from Bruce: in fact there was a GUI done by Javier Urien but I didn't known this… Check [www.divx-digest.com](https://www.divx-digest.com/software/perso_normalize_gui.html) to get it.)

This is the second release of the GUI, new stuff are :
- Addition of the batch processing mode
- Possibility to translate the GUI easily thanks to a .ini file ;)

If you want to do a translation of the GUI in your language, do not hesitate, it's quite easy, just add a section of the name of the language in the .ini file, and translate sentenses :)
Send me your translations on my email adress.
If I did a mistake (english is not my native language), please tell me where so I can correct it ;)
