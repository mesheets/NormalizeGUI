Normalize GUI v0.2.1 by Bruce Heller <bheller@bheller.com>

After some research over the net, I discover that there wasn't any GUI for the great tool Normalize is.
So I decided to take a little of my time to do one.
This is what you got now ;).
(UPDATE : in fact there was a GUI done by Javier Urien but I didn't known this... Check www.divx-digest.com to get it)

This is the second release of the GUI, new stuff are :
- Addition of the batch processing mode
- Possibility to translate the GUI easily thanks to a .ini file ;)

If you want to do a translation of the GUI in your language, do not hesitate, it's quite easy, just add a section of the name of the language in the .ini file, and translate sentenses :)
Send me your translations on my email adress.
If I did a mistake (english is not my native language), please tell me where so I can correct it ;)
